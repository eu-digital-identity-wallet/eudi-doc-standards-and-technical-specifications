# EUDI Wallet Standards and Technical Specifications

## Overview  
The **European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet Standards and Technical Specifications** aims to provide a structured and transparent approach to tracking, evaluating, and aligning the necessary **Standards and Technical Specifications (STS)** with the relevant **Implementing Acts (IA)** of [Regulation (EU) No 910/2014](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910) as amended by [Regulation (EU) 2024/1183](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj/eng) establishing the European Digital Identity Framework.  

This repository serves as a centralized resource for:  
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifying missing or incomplete standards required for the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.  
- **Roadmap Planning**: Defining a timeline for when these gaps will be addressed and new STS will be ready for reference in Implementing Acts.  
- **Technical Specifications**: Listing the ([technical specifications](docs/technical-specifications/README.md)) that are being developed by the EC, in collaboration with the European Digital
Identity Cooperation Group and the European Standards Organisations (ESO), to support the implementation of the
European Digital Identity Wallet
- **Public Transparency**: Offering a clear view of the ongoing work and enabling feedback from stakeholders.

## Repository Structure  

### 1. Issues ([View Issues](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/ec-internal-standards/issues))  
Each issue represents a specific **Standard or Technical Specification (STS)** relevant to the EUDI Wallet. Issues are categorized as:  

- **Existing STS with gaps**: A standard exists but does not fully meet EUDI Wallet requirements.  
- **Missing STS**: No relevant standard currently exists, requiring the development of a new one.  
- **Existing STS with no gaps (Candidate STS)**: A standard exists, and no gaps have been identified. It is considered a **Candidate**, meaning it is awaiting final assessment for potential referencing in Implementing Acts. Issues in this category are **marked as closed** once they reach this stage.  

Issues are tagged using **labels** that link them to:  
- **Regulatory Articles** from Implementing Acts  
- **Functional Requirements** from the EUDI Wallet Architecture Reference Framework  
- **Status** of the standardisation process  
- **Responsible Standardisation Body (SDO)**  

### 2. Project Board ([View Board](https://github.com/orgs/eu-digital-identity-wallet/projects/29))  
The **Project Board** provides a **Kanban-style view** where issues are organized by their **status**:  

- **Backlog**: The need for a new technical specification has been identified as relevant to the **EUDI Wallet requirements**, but no suitable STS is currently available or under development.  
- **In Progress**: A relevant STS exists, but **gaps have been identified**, the document is incomplete, or it is still in draft form. Work is actively being done to address the gaps.  
- **Done**: An STS has either reached a **stable version** and is currently considered a **Candidate**, meaning **no gaps have been identified but final assessment is pending**.  

### 3. List View ([View List](https://github.com/orgs/eu-digital-identity-wallet/projects/29/views/4))  
A structured list of all STS-related issues, sorted by milestones and development status. Milestones cluster similar topics together to facilitate assessment and scheduling.  

### 4. Roadmap View ([View Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/eu-digital-identity-wallet/projects/29/views/1))  
A **timeline visualisation** of STS development, including:  
- **Start & Target Dates** for each STS  
- **Expected milestone when an STS is anticipated to meet the technical requirements of the EUDI Wallet**
