## Overview
> In this section, we should give an executive overview answering the question, “What is a Standardization Strategy and why do we need it”.

A standardization strategy for the EU Digital Identity Wallet is a comprehensive plan designed to establish, promote, and maintain standards within the digital identity domain. This strategy focuses on creating and implementing standards that ensure the digital identity solution is consistent, secure, GDPR compliant, interoperable, and user-friendly across all EU member states. It will align with existing relevant standards and regulations to ensure coherence and compliance across the board.

## Objective
Establish and maintain robust standards to ensure consistency, security, interoperability, GDPR compliance, and support for Implementing Acts and public procurements across all EU member states.

## Key Components:

- **Assessment**: Analyse current practices against the latest EUDIW Architectural Reference Framework (ARF), which is available on GitHub. This analysis aims to identify gaps in high-level requirements for implementing the eIDAS Regulation.
  
- **Planning**: Identify the nature of the gaps and plan a course of action for each one. This involves determining whether gaps can be filled by existing standards, require the development of new standards, or need interim technical specifications.

- **Integration into Public Procurements**: Facilitate the use of standardized solutions in public procurements by referencing approved standards.

- **Support for Implementing Acts**: Assist in the preparation of the Implementing Acts by providing comprehensive analysis, gap identification, and recommendations for integrating standards and technical specifications. 

> **Notice**: 'Standards' include Technical Specifications eligible through the European Multi-Stakeholder Platform on ICT Standardisation (MSP).

## Gap Analysis Process

- **Needs Identification**: A detailed analysis of the EUDI Wallet functionalities against the ARF to identify the required standards and technical specifications. Specifically, it focuses on pinpointing areas where existing standards or technical specifications do not adequately support the required functionalities. This includes a thorough evaluation of each high-level requirement to determine whether it is fully supported, partially supported, or not supported at all by the current standards.

- **Gap Mapping**: Classify the identified needs into categories based on the availability and status of existing standards and specifications and map these functionalities to the specific standards and technical specifications that support them:
  - **Existing Standards Published**: Standards that are already published and available for use.
  - **Existing Standards in Draft or Under Development**: Standards that are currently being developed or are in draft form by recognized SDOs.
  - **Existing Technical Specifications from Non-SDOs**: Technical specifications published or in draft form by non-SDOs such as OpenID4VP by OpenID and Verifiable Credentials by W3C.
  - **Needs Not Covered by Any Available Standards or Specifications**: Functionalities and requirements that are not addressed by any existing standards or technical specifications.

- **Documentation & Reporting**: Develop a detailed report titled "Fiche for Implementing Act Article 5.23 Protocols and Interfaces" that will:
  - Identify standards and specifications mentioned in the ARF and Implementing Acts, both published and in preparation.
  - Describe missing standards and specifications as well as gaps in existing standards and technical specifications.
  - Provide a comprehensive overview based on the ARF, including its annexes, and highlight any gaps or missing standards for functionalities described in the ARF or Implementing Acts.
  - Dictate the next steps for filling the gaps and support the preparation of the Implementing Acts.
  
  > **Note**: It considers only the standards and specifications directly referenced in the ARF.

## Strategy for Addressing Gaps

- **Engage with SDOs to Address Gaps in Existing Standards**:
  - **Identification**: Start by identifying the specific gaps where existing standards do not fully meet the requirements outlined in the ARF or Implementing Acts.
  - **Engagement**: Reach out to relevant Standard Developing Organizations (SDOs) like ISO, ETSI, CEN, and others to discuss these gaps through formal meetings, workshops, and continuous dialogue.
  - **Collaboration**: Work collaboratively with these SDOs to influence the development or enhancement of standards by contributing to working groups, providing technical input, and participating in the drafting process.
  - **Monitoring**: Keep track of the progress of these developments to ensure that the necessary updates or new standards are being addressed in a timely manner.

- **Initiate the MSP Process for Non-SDO Specifications**:
  - **Submission Preparation**: Prepare detailed submissions for the European Multi-Stakeholder Platform on ICT Standardisation (MSP), including all necessary documentation and justification for why the non-SDO specifications should be recognized.
  - **Criteria Adherence**: Ensure that the submissions meet the MSP’s criteria for evaluation, such as market relevance, openness, and regulatory compliance.
  - **Review and Approval**: Engage with the MSP during their review process to address any questions or concerns.
  - **Follow-up**: After approval, ensure that these specifications are properly referenced in the relevant Implementing Acts and public procurement guidelines.

- **Develop Internal Specifications for Minor Functionalities Where Necessary**:
  - **Scope Definition**: Clearly define what constitutes a minor functionality that can be addressed internally rather than requiring a new or updated standard. This includes functionalities such as the structure and data types of fields in a payload of an attestation.
  - **Documentation**: Develop comprehensive technical specifications for these minor functionalities, ensuring they are aligned with the overall architecture and other standards.
  - **Stakeholder Review**: Conduct internal reviews with stakeholders to validate these specifications and gather feedback for improvement.
  - **Implementation Support**: Provide clear implementation guidelines and support materials to ensure they are correctly adopted by member states and other stakeholders.

- **Assign Responsibility for Major Functionalities**:
  - **Scope Identification**: Identify major functionalities that require new or updated standards beyond the scope of minor internal specifications.
  - **Engage with Recognized SDOs**: Assign the responsibility for developing these standards to recognized European Standardization Organizations (e.g., ETSI). This ensures that the development process is robust, leverages appropriate expertise, and includes a commitment to ongoing maintenance.
  - **Financial Support**: Secure funding through grants, including Action Grants from DG GROW and potential financial support options such as open calls from StandICT.eu. This helps ensure that the necessary resources are available for the development and maintenance of these standards.
  - **Coordination**: Coordinate with these SDOs to ensure that the developed standards meet the EUDIW requirements and are ready for integration into the Implementing Acts.

## Influencing Standards Development through Action Grants

To effectively influence the development of new standards or further the enhancement of existing ones for the **EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW)**, a structured approach must be taken. This process works specifically with **ETSI** and **CEN/CENELEC** through the mechanism of **Action Grants**, which are available via **DG Grow** to support such activities.

### Steps for Engaging ETSI and CEN/CENELEC

1. **Engage with European Standardization Organizations (ESO)**:  
   The first step is to establish an agreement with the relevant ESOs (ETSI and CEN/CENELEC) on the scope of work that needs to be developed. This could include the creation of new standards or the enhancement of existing ones to meet the needs outlined in the EUDIW’s architectural framework and its alignment with the eIDAS regulation.

2. **Utilize DG Grow’s Action Grants**:  
   Action Grants, specifically offered by DG Grow, provide the necessary financial support to fund standardization efforts. This process is tailored for **ETSI** and **CEN/CENELEC** and follows a clearly defined timeline within a fiscal year:

   - **Application Periods**: Grants can be requested during three points within a calendar year:
     - **Start of the year (January)**: The recommended time to begin the application process.
     - **Mid-year (June)**: Another window, but contingent on available funds.
     - **End of year (October)**: Typically used only if there is unspent budget remaining.

   Action Grants ensure that ETSI and CEN/CENELEC have the resources required to develop or refine standards. There is no need to go through more cumbersome procedures such as Comitology.

   > **Note**: This funding mechanism applies exclusively to ETSI and CEN/CENELEC. Other standards bodies or alternative standardization approaches are not covered by these grants.

3. **Coordinate with DG Grow**:  
   It is essential to work in close collaboration with DG Grow to prepare the required documentation for the Action Grant proposals. This involves:

   - **Preparation of Project Proposals**: A detailed description of the work and the expected deliverables must be prepared. It is vital to ensure that the deliverables are clearly aligned with the needs of the EUDIW and the objectives of the grant.
   - **Call for Proposals**: In January, DG Grow typically announces the first round of calls for proposals. The proposal should be prepared in time for this deadline.
   - **Approval and Evaluation**: DG Grow will publish the call, and the European Standardization Organizations (ETSI and CEN/CENELEC) will respond by submitting their proposals, outlining how they plan to address the requested tasks. DG Grow will evaluate the submissions and determine the beneficiaries for the grants.

4. **Engage with D3 for Technical Assistance**:  
   The **D3 Unit** can assist in the preparation of calls for proposals that DG Grow will publish. This collaboration is important to ensure the technical specifications required by EUDIW are addressed comprehensively in the proposal. 

5. **Finalization and Execution**:  
   Once the proposals have been submitted by ETSI and CEN/CENELEC and evaluated by DG Grow, it is essential to ensure proper follow-up. Regular communication with both DG Grow and the standardization bodies will ensure that the project remains on track and that deliverables are met within the agreed timelines.

### Additional Considerations

While **Action Grants** are the primary vehicle for developing standards in collaboration with ETSI and CEN/CENELEC, there is also the possibility of leveraging **research projects** developed within the **EUDIW** framework. However, this approach requires participating in or initiating a research project, which can be a more complex and resource-intensive option. Therefore, it is advised to focus on the Action Grants process unless specific research opportunities are already being pursued.

## Updates Based on Implementing Acts
- **Plan for Continuous Updates**: Plan for continuous updates of the fiche document to reflect changes in Implementing Acts.
- **Regular Review and Updates**: Establish a process for regular review and updates of the fiche document to ensure it remains current and comprehensive.

## Formally Recognized SDOs

- Regulation EU No 1025/2012 [Link](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012R1025)
  - This regulation identifies three main SDOs whose standards are recognized across the European Union:
    - CEN (European Committee for Standardization)
    - CENELEC (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization)
    - ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute)

## International Bodies
In article 2(9), the following international bodies are mentioned as recognized:

- International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)
- International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
- International Telecommunication Union (ITU)

### ISO/IEC
ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is not formally recognized as a European Standards Developing Organization (SDO) under [Regulation (EU) No 1025/201](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012R1025)2. The regulation specifically recognizes three European SDOs: CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI.
However, ISO standards are widely used and can be adopted or referenced by these European SDOs in their own standards.

## Role of the European Multi-Stakeholder Platform on ICT Standardisation (MSP)

The MSP plays a critical role in ensuring that technical specifications from non-traditional standardization bodies are recognized and can be referenced in Implementing Acts and public procurements.

### Functions of MSP
- **Evaluation**: The MSP evaluates technical specifications developed by non-formal standardization bodies (e.g., W3C for Verifiable Credentials). This evaluation determines if these specifications meet the necessary criteria for formal recognition and referencing.
- **Eligibility**: Once the MSP approves a technical specification, it becomes eligible for referencing in official EU documents and can be used in public procurement processes. This ensures a broader range of innovative solutions can be integrated into the EUDIW framework.
- **Support**: The MSP process provides guidance and support to non-SDOs (Standard Developing Organizations) to help them meet the eligibility criteria. This includes advice on documentation, compliance with EU regulations, and alignment with existing standards.

### Process
  - **Submission**: Non-SDOs submit their technical specifications to the MSP for review.
  - **Review**: The MSP conducts a thorough review considering factors such as market relevance, openness, and adherence to regulatory requirements.
  - **Approval**: Approved specifications are published and listed as eligible for official referencing.

### Strategic Importance
The MSP process ensures that the EUDIW can leverage cutting-edge technologies and specifications from a variety of sources, not just traditional SDOs. This flexibility is crucial for maintaining the EUDIW's relevance and effectiveness in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

## Notice 
The term 'standards' in this document includes Technical Specifications rendered eligible through the European Multi-Stakeholder Platform on ICT Standardisation (MSP).

## Conclusion
This strategy document outlines a comprehensive approach to establishing and maintaining robust standards for the EUDIW. It ensures the EUDIW will be secure, interoperable, GDPR compliant, and user-friendly across all EU member states.

## Desk Level Assessment for Technical Specifications

The Desk Level Assessment is an evaluation process designed to ensure that Technical Specifications (TS), which do not originate from recognized Standardization Organizations, meet the necessary standards to be referenced in EU legal texts such as Implementing Acts. This assessment ensures compliance with relevant regulations and standards, confirming that the TS adhere to the required levels of technical accuracy, transparency, and legal validity.

By applying specific criteria—such as technical compliance with the eIDAS regulation, adherence to the requirements of Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, and compliance with access to documents requirements—this assessment ensures that only TS meeting these requirements are considered for inclusion in EU legislation. The Legal Service of DG Grow will use this assessment to make informed decisions on the acceptance and referencing of these TS, supporting the integrity and effectiveness of the legal framework.

### Criteria for Assessment
The Desk Level Assessment of Technical Specifications should be conducted based on the following criteria as communicated by the DG Connect D3 Unit:

1. **Technical Compliance with the eIDAS Regulation**: The TS must demonstrate strict adherence to the requirements and provisions of the eIDAS regulation. This regulation is fundamental in ensuring trust, security, and legal validity in electronic transactions within the European Union. The TS should be part of a broader technical assessment conducted with the support of EU Member States (EUMS) and relevant stakeholders, such as expert groups. This involvement adds significant credibility to the TS, strengthening the case for its inclusion in legal texts.

2. **Requirements of Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012**: The TS should comply with the criteria laid down in Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. This regulation provides the framework for European standardization and outlines the essential requirements that need to be met for a standard to be considered for referencing in EU legislation. The TS must demonstrate that it meets these criteria, ensuring it aligns with the broader objectives of European standardization.

3. **Compliance with Access to Documents Requirements**: Following the recent European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling, there is a heightened emphasis on transparency and public accessibility of standards referenced in legal texts. The TS must be publicly available and accessible to stakeholders and the general public. This transparency is crucial to uphold the principles of openness and accountability in EU legislative processes.

> **Regulation 2012/1025 - Article 13, Article 14, Annex II**

### Conclusion:
The Desk Level Assessment serves as a robust mechanism to evaluate Technical Specifications that do not originate from recognized Standardization Organizations. By rigorously applying the above criteria, this assessment ensures that only those TS that meet the highest standards of compliance, transparency, and technical rigor are considered for inclusion in EU legal texts. The Legal Service of DG Grow will use this assessment to make informed decisions regarding the acceptance and referencing of these TS in Implementing Acts.
