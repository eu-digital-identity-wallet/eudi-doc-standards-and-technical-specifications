### 2.2 High-Level Requirements

The set of high-level requirements after the discussions documented in the [L+M-Discussion-Paper](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/discussion-topics/l%2Bm-data-deletion-and-reporting-of-wrp-to-dpa.md) and 
the two focus meeting on the present topic, which slightly changed `DATA_DLT_02` and `DATA_DLT_07` 
and added `DATA_DLT_08` and `DATA_DLT_09` are as follows:

| **Index**    | **Requirement specification** |
|---|---|
| DATA_DLT_01  | A Wallet Provider SHALL ensure that its Wallet Units support the technical specifications mentioned in DATA_DLT_02, allowing a User to request from a Relying Party the erasure of their attributes that were presented by that Wallet Unit to that Relying Party, in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.|
| DATA_DLT_02  | A Wallet Unit SHALL support the following possibilities to request data deletion from a Wallet-Relying Party: a)  Open a URL in an external browser, which is assumed to be available on the platform, to ask for the deletion of data in a web form provided by the Wallet-Relying Party. b)  Open an external mail client, if available on the platform, and start a draft email to the Wallet-Relying Party (see also `DATA_DLT_08` below). c) Open a phone application, if available on the platform, in order to call the Wallet-Relying Party. |
| DATA_DLT_03  | A Wallet Instance SHALL provide a function where the User may select one Relying Party for which an attribute deletion request must be submitted.|
| DATA_DLT_05  | A Wallet Unit SHALL include attribute deletion requests in a log so they can be presented to the User via the dashboard (as specified in [Topic 19](#a2319-topic-19---user-navigation-requirements-dashboard-logs-for-transparency)). |
| DATA_DLT_06  | The log SHALL also document the initiation of a data deletion request and include as a minimum: - Date and time of attribute deletion request, - Relying Party to which the request was made, - Attributes requested to be removed.|
| DATA_DLT_07  | Before executing a data deletion request, a Wallet-Relying Party SHALL authenticate the requesting User, or the request itself, using appropriate authentication mechanisms of its own choice. The Wallet-Relying Party SHOULD use the authentication and signature facilities offered by the User's Wallet Unit for this purpose. |
| DATA_DLT_08  | The text in the `subject` of the mail prepared by the Wallet Unit according to `DATA_DLT_02` (b) SHALL clearly indicate that the purpose of the mail is to asks for the deletion of the personal data according to Article 17 of (EU) 2016/679, which has been previously provided by the user via its Wallet Unit. |
| DATA_DLT_09  | The text in the `body` of the mail prepared by the Wallet Unit according to `DATA_DLT_02` (b) SHOULD contain the necessary information for the WRP to handle the request in an appropriate manner. This in particular includes the information which personal attributes are requested to be deleted, or that all previously exchanged personal data are requested to be deleted. |


## 3. Specification of Protocols and Interfaces

### 3.1 System Architecture 

As agreed upon within the discussions documented in the [L+M-Discussion-Paper](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/discussion-topics/l%2Bm-data-deletion-and-reporting-of-wrp-to-dpa.md) 
the general approach is to utilise the already existing interfaces and processes of the 
Wallet-Relying Parties as much as possible and abstain from the creation of 
additional technical interfaces.

The resulting system architecture is depicted in the following figure:

![Overview](img/ts7-architecture.svg) 

### 3.2 Interfaces

As shown in the figure above, there are the following interfaces:

* **(I1)** - is a user-friendly user interface, which allows to access the functionality of the Wallet Unit, 
  browse through the Transaction Log, search for transactions within a given period in time or with a given Wallet-Relying Party 
  and in particular allows to request the deletion of the previously provided personal data according to Article 17
  [(EU) 2016/679](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj) at a specific Wallet-Relying Party.

* **(I2)** - is the API to the National Register according to Article 3 of
  [(EU) 2025/848](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/848/oj), which allows
  to retrieve the registered `supportURI` elements of a WRP, if this is necessary.

* **(I3)** - is a platform-specific interface, which allows to invoke a browser on the platform to open a specific
  URL of the WRP, which has been provided in the `supportURI` element within the registration information in
  [STS-TS5](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts5-common-formats-and-api-for-rp-registration-information.md). The web application available at this URL is assumed to provide further information how to request the
  deletion of the personal data, which has previously been provided by a Wallet Unit.

* **(I4)** - represents a logical interface provided by the web application hosted by the Wallet-Relying party at the given  
  URL contained in the `supportURI` of the Wallet-Relying party according to [STS-TS5](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts5-common-formats-and-api-for-rp-registration-information.md). Note, that it is assumed
  that there is always a browser on the platform, but a mail client is considered to be optional. Therefore, it is 
  RECOMMENDED in [STS-TS5](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts5-common-formats-and-api-for-rp-registration-information.md) that WRPs register a `supportURI`, which points to the website for helpdesk
  and support according to ANNEX I Nr. 7 (a) [(EU) 2025/848](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/848/oj).

* **(I5)** - is a platform-specific interface, which allows to invoke a mail client on the platform, if available. 
  The invocation can be realised using a `mailto:` link with the email address of the WRP, a suitable text for the `subject` 
  of the mail and a proposal of a text for the `body` of the mail in which the data subject asks for the deletion of the personal data, 
  which has previously been provided by a Wallet Unit. 

* **(I6)** - represents a logical interface given by the mail system of the WRP, which is
  assumed to exist, if the registration information with respect to the `supportURI` of the WRP according to [STS-TS5](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts5-common-formats-and-api-for-rp-registration-information.md)
  contains an email address for support. Note, that the Wallet Unit can recognise the type of the endpoint, which is either 
  an email address, the URL of a website or a phone number, by inspecting the content of the `supportURI` element. 

* **(I7)** - is a platform-specific interface, which allows to invoke the phone application of the platform.

* **(I8)** - is the phone system of the WRP, which SHALL exist, if there is only a phone number 
  registered within the `supportURI` element of [STS-TS5](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts5-common-formats-and-api-for-rp-registration-information.md), as admissibly by ANNEX I Nr. 7 (b) [(EU) 2025/848](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/848/oj).

* **(I9)** - is the normalized and mandatory technical interface of a Wallet Unit based on the [OID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html) protocol, 
  which allows to ask for the strong identification of the data subject or the creation of a qualified electronic signature for a provided
  text, which asks for the deletion of previously provided personal data. Whether this interface of the Wallet Unit is 
  invoked or not is determined by the Wallet-Relying Party.    

> **Open Issue 1**: The technical details with respect to the creation of qualified electronic 
> signatures, or otherwise authenticating the requesting user for the specific data deletion transaction here, 
> are not yet completely specified yet. While the authorization of the creation of qualified electronic
> signatures or seals according to Art. 5a (4) (e) of [(EU) No. 910/2014](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj) is expected to be possible 
> using suitable `transaction_data` according to clause 8.4 of [OID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html) with a suitable 
> transaction type, the technical details are currently not completely specified yet. 

### 3.3 Process

The process for requesting the deletion of personal data according to Article 17 [(EU) 2016/679](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj)  and Article 5a (5) (a) (ix) of [(EU) No 910/2014](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/2024-10-18) contains the following 
simple steps:

* **(1)** - The Wallet Unit determines the best available way for contacting the WRP to request the deletion of data by considering the different possible cases as specified in the following. 
  The Wallet Unit shall perform the following steps in the specified order:
* **(1.1)** (WRPRC available): In this case, the Wallet Unit can directly look up the available `supportURI` elements from the WRPRC according to Article 8 of [(EU) 2025/848](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/848/oj) and can immediately evaluate the following subcases in the specified order:
  * **(1.1.1)** (Website for helpdesk and support available): In this case the Wallet Unit SHALL invoke a browser, which is assumed to be present on the platform, and open the URL provided in `supportURI`.
  * **(1.1.2)** (No website, but email available): In this case the Wallet Unit SHALL invoke an email client, if available on the platform, and 
    prefill the `subject`, as specified in `DATA_DLT_08`, and the `body`, as specified in `DATA_DLT_09`, 
    in order to request the deletion of data in line with Art. 17 of [(EU) 2016/679](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).
  * **(1.1.3)** (Only phone number available): In this case the Wallet Unit SHALL use the phone number
    provided in the `supportURI` element and open the phone application on the platform such that the 
    user can verbally request the deletion of data from the WRP.
* **(1.2)** (Only WRPAC available): In this case the Wallet Unit SHALL perform the following simple steps:
  * **(1.2.1)** The Wallet Unit SHALL ask the User, whether he agrees to contact the national register via its
    API according to Art. 3 Nr. 5 [(EU) 2025/848](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/848/oj) 
    in order to retrieve the registered `supportURI` elements of the WRP. 
  * **(1.2.2)** If the User has agreed to contact the national registry, the Wallet Unit will 
    use the interface (I2) depicted in the figure above to retrieve the registered `supportURI` elements of the WRP.
* **(2)** - The Wallet Unit invokes the external application determined in step (1) above, i.e. 
  a browser, a mail client or the phone application on the platform of the user, and adds the 
  initiated deletion request to the transaction log as specified in `DATA_DLT_05` and `DATA_DLT_06`, 
  such that it may later on be displayed to the user, as required by Article 6 Nr. of [(EU) 2024/2982](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2982/oj).
* **(3)** - The data deletion request, which was initiated in step (2), will finally be handled by the WRP. Note, that this step is  
  out of the scope of the present specification.

> **Open Issue 2**: The detailed structure of the WRPRC according to Article 8 of [(EU) 2024/2980](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2980/oj) is currently neither specified in
> the Technical Specification [TS5](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts5-common-formats-and-api-for-rp-registration-information.md#3-common-application-programming-interface) of the European Commission
> nor in the latest draft [ETSI TS 119 475 (Draft 0.0.6)](https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=69585). It SHALL be ensured, that the `supportURI` elements are present in the final WRPRC specification.

> **Open Issue 3**: For step (1.2.1) above the Wallet Unit needs to know the endpoint of the API of the national register 
> according to Article 3 Nr. 5 [(EU) 2025/848](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/848/oj). This information
> could either be included in the WRPAC according to [ETSI TS 119 411-8](https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=74431)
> or looked up with an additional call to the Secure Notification System provided by the
> European Commission according to Article 3 (1) of [(EU) 2024/2980](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2980/oj)
> as described in clause 3 of the Technical Specification [TS2](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts2-notification-publication-provider-information.md).
> Note, that this additional call is not depicted in the figure above and both options
> require more or less small changes in the current drafts of the mentioned specifications. In order to avoid
> the creation of frequently accessed central system, which would then be susceptible for 
> denial-of-service attack, it seems to be preferable to include the registered `supportURI` 
> elements in the WRPAC.
