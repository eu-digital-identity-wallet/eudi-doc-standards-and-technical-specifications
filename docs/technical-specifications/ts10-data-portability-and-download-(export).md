## Abstract

The present document specifies the common format and data set for the transaction log and the Migration Object, as well as protocols related to exporting those objects from a Wallet Unit and importing to another one in a backup, recovery and migration scenarios, as required by the [European Digital Identity Regulation (EU 2024/1183)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32024R1183) and [CIR 2024/2979](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/2979/oj/eng).

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

According to [Regulation (EU) No 910/2014] with the amending [Regulation (EU) 2024/1183] (hereinafter together referred as the [European Digital Identity Regulation]) and [CIR on Integrity and Core Functionalities], the Wallet Units shall keep a transaction log, as well as a "migration object" that can be used to export User's data from a Wallet Unit and to import it to another Wallet Unit, in backup, recovery and migration processes.
The relevant requirements are set out in Article 5a(4)(f) and (g) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] and Article 9 and 13 of the [CIR on Integrity and Core Functionalities].

The migration process has the following steps:

- creation of the migration object (which is a password-protected and encrypted file) in the existing Wallet Unit, which contains the list of credentials and the transaction log,
- exporting and storing the migration object in a User preferred location, such as an external disk or a cloud storage (from locations supported by the Wallet Solution),
- importing the migration object to a new Wallet Unit,
- initiating the process of migration i.a. with use of the password to decrypt the file,  
- (automatic) issuance of the PID and/or other Attestations that were present in the old Wallet Unit (as listed in the migration object's list of credentials), as well as restoring the transaction log (from the migration object's transaction log).

Further details and requirements related to the migration process are presented in the ARF Annex 2 Topic 34.

### 1.2 Scope of the document

The present document specifies:

- the common format and content for the transaction log,
- the common format and content for the migration object,
- security measures to protect confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the transaction log and the migration object, in storage, backup, recovery and migration processes.

The migration object contains:

- a file containing the list of credentials (PIDs and attestations) present in a Wallet Unit,
- a transaction log file.

### 1.3 Requirements Notation

The key words "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 RFC8174 when, and only when, they are written in all capital letters.

## 2 Data Model

The present data model has been created based on the legal requirements of [European Digital Identity Regulation] (including the related implementing acts),  and [ARF], while keeping the [SEMIC Style Guide](https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/index.html) in mind and aligning it with the [Core Business Vocabulary](https://semiceu.github.io/Core-Business-Vocabulary/releases/2.2.0/) as much as reasonable.

![MigrationObjectAndTransactionLogDataModel](img/ts10-eudiw-mig-obj-trans-log-datamodel.svg)

As outlined in the above figure, it contains the following **main classes**:

- **Transaction**
- **Presentation**
- **PseudonymPresentation**
- **W2WPresentationRequest**
- **W2WPresentation**
- **CredentialIssuance**
- **CredentialDeletion**
- **PseudonymGeneration**

- **SigningSealing**
- **DataDeletionRequest**
- **DPAReport**
- **OtherTransaction**
- **TransactionLog**
- **TransactionLogObject**
- **ListOfCredentials**
- **MigrationObject**

These classes are defined using the following **auxiliary classes**:

- **TransactionIdentifier**
- **CredentialInfo**
- **ClaimInfo**
- **Pseudonym**

These classes depend on the following auxiliary classes specified in the [Relying Party registration specification] and the [Provider information specification]:

- **Credential**
- **LegalEntity**
- **LegalPerson**
- **NaturalPerson**
- **IntendedUse**
- **Identifier**
- **MultiLangString**
- **Policy**

The following algorithms are mandatory for [JWE] objects encryption:

* [PBES2-HS256+A128KW](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html#section-4.8), as specified in [JWA] and [PKCS#5] - to derive the key encryption key from the User's password/passphrase and encrypt the content encryption key,
* [A128GCM](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html#section-5.3), as specified in [JWA] - for the content encryption with the content encryption key.

The encryption process is visualised in the diagram below:
