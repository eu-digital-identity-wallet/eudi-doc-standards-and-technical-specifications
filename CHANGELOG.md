# CHANGELOG
## Gap Analysis Maintenance Process

### 1. Ongoing Monitoring
- Monitor all the standards that are referenced in the ARF and Implementing Acts. - `NiScy`
- Identify and register in the relevant Working Groups and forums that are developing the standards. `TBD WHO`
- Subscribe to the Working Groups and forums newsletters and mailing lists, and set up alerts. - `NiScy`
- Create a central document where all findings, updates, and important developments are logged - `CHANGELOG.md`

### 2. Periodic Reviews
- Every two months (or immediately after critical changes in the standardization landscape) review and analyze the current state of standards against the gaps already identified in the repository.
- Conduct review meetings with stakeholders (CNECT, NiScy ARF team, etc.) to discuss new findings and update gaps.
- Assess relevance, i.e., analyze if the new developments impact the current gap analysis.

### 3. Document Changes
- Keep clear and organized records to track what was updated and when - `CHANGELOG.md`
- Log the date of the update and list specific changes made to the gap analysis (e.g., new drafts/standards introduced, old ones deprecated, specific areas now in compliance, etc). This should be logged in real-time during the review process.
- Update the issues in the repository with the latest gap assessments and justifications for any changes.
