# Gap Analysis Maintenance Process and Change Log

## Instructions

### 1. Ongoing Monitoring
- **Monitor Standards**: Regularly monitor all standards referenced in the ARF and Implementing Acts. - `NiScy`
- **Identify Relevant Groups**: Identify and register with the relevant Working Groups and forums where these standards are being developed. `TBD WHO`
- **Subscribe to Updates**: Subscribe to newsletters, mailing lists, and set up alerts for these Working Groups and forums. - `NiScy`
- **Log Findings**: Create a central document (`CHANGELOG.md`) to log all findings, updates, and significant developments.

### 2. Periodic Reviews
- **Bi-Monthly Review**: Every two months—or immediately after critical changes in the standardization landscape—review and analyze the current state of standards against the gaps identified in the repository.
- **Review Meetings**: Conduct review meetings with stakeholders (e.g., CNECT, NiScy ARF team) to discuss new findings and update identified gaps.
- **Assess Relevance**: Analyze the impact of new developments on the current gap analysis and update as needed.

### 3. Document Changes
- **Maintain Clear Records**: Track and document all updates, including the date, changes made, and any specific impacts on the gap analysis. Use `CHANGELOG.md` to log changes in real-time during the review process.
- **Log Specific Changes**: List each update’s details, such as newly introduced or deprecated standards and areas now in compliance.
- **Update Repository**: Reflect all gap assessments and justifications for changes in the repository issues.
